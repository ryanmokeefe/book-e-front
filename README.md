# Book-E Front-End

This repo contains a client-side jQuery-based application that will connect to your local API we've built during class. If you haven't kept up in-class with building the Express API, don't worry-- see the setup instructions below.

## Set up

1. Clone down this repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. In the directory for `book-e-backend`, check out the `solution` branch and run `nodemon`.

## Instructions

You will be writing code for making AJAX requests to the Express-based `book-e-backend` API in three functions: `handlePost`, `handleDelete`, and `handlePut`. There are comments in `script.js` instructing where to write your AJAX code, as well as some critical hints to help you get started. Part of the code for your `POST` request code is already present.
